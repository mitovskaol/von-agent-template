# This section contains credential dependencies. A credential can have multiple dependencies. In this example,  Test Credential depends on a previously issued
# Business Registration credential. Before a Test Credential can be issued to an Identity Holder's Wallet (i.e. TheOrgBook), 
# a proof request is sent to the Identity Holder's wallet to verify that it contains a Business Regstration Credential (a list of attributes from the Business Reg credential that will be verified are defined in the attribute section below) and 
# that it was issued by the specified Issuer (Issuer details are defined in the key section below ) and that this Bus Reg Credential is valid (not revoked). 
 # NOTE: Make sure the dependecy credentials have been successfully loaded into the local instance of TheOrgBook BEFORE issuing the credentials that depend on them, otherwise, the issuance will fail. Check the local instance of von-network
 # for the issuer and dependency credential details such as versions, schema names, Issuer DID, etc that are required to populate the section below.
 #If your credential has NO dependencies, delete the section below.
